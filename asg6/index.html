	<h1>White Hat</h1>
	<p>The goal of the website is to create a visual codex for the game Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
	<p>Final Fantasy XIV is an MMORPG which includes up to 5 expansions that can take upwards to 100+ hours for each expansion.</p>
	<p>The issue is that the game contains a great deal of lore featuring unique terminonlogy, its own measurement system, alternate dimensions and dozens of factions and countries. The game's lore can become increasingly difficult to keep track of and it lacks a good codex system to keep track of it all.</p>
	<p>The solution for this problem was discovered when I played Final Fantasy XVI which featured a robust codex system that not only gave detailed descriptions of each character and their current status in the narrative but also included links such as locations, terminology, and lore</p>
	<p>My goal is create a similar codex system for Final Fantasy XIV.</p>

	<h2>Red Hat</h2>
	<p>By creating a visual based codex system, I hope to provide players with clarity and a far greater understanding of the game's narrative & lore.</p>
	<h3>Black Hat</h3>
	<p>When talking to my partner about this website, the biggest criticism I faced when describing my concept for my website is that it might be too advanced for my current skillset at the moment.</p>
	<p>Another criticism I recieved is that due to the game's massive scope (it being an MMO with 5 expansions, each one taking hundreds of hours to complete) that this would be too massive of an undertaking for me to complete in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
	<h4>Yellow Hat</h4>
	<p>The solution that me and my partner suggested was that we keep the scope relegated to the "A Realm Reborn" portion of the MMO which is the base game of Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
	<p>This would allow me to finish this concept in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
