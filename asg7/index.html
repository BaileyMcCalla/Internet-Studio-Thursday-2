<h2>Why you should vote for Senator Jar Jar Binks as a running mate</h2>
<p>Senator Jar Jar Binks was a key figure in giving Senator Palpatine emergency powers during the beginning of the Clone Wars. As both Palpatine & Jar Jar Binks are from Naboo this tells you that they are good candidates as Naboo has a good track record when it comes to politicians. Having a Gungan as Palpatine's running mate is good for diversity.</p>
