	My visual & interaction design is based primarily around both clarity & minimalism. My goal is to ensure that any viewer who uses this site will have a complete understanding of how everything works the second they lay eyes on the page.

	For typefont I used sans-serif fonts specifically for it's clarity and relation to the way Bungie designed the Forerunner archetecture in Halo which had a tendency to be curved with sharp angular edges which alot of sans-serif fonts contain. For the h1,h2 & ul font, I went for a font called "stack sans notch" which had a sci-fi look to the font which I belive fits well with the Halo's sci-fi genre. The color pallet uses light & dark blues as this is one of the primary color schemes for Halo.

Button styles were shaped to be rounded and large so that viewers can spot them easily as well as making them astheticly pleasing to the eye. The image sizes were shunk down as to not take up too much of the screen.</p>
