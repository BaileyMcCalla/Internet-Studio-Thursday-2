<h1>Advantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software</h2>
<p>The main advantage of sketching over using software is that you have far more control over the type of layout that you want to make compared to wireframe software which depending on which type of software you are using may be limited in its capabilites & features.</p>
<h2>Disadvantage of using wireframe wireframes over wireframe software</h2>
<p>The main drawback to sketchinbg wireframes is that what you sketch may not be feasible when coding it using html5. This is where the advantage of using software comes into play as said software is designed around the feasibility of coding in html5.</p>
<h3>Which wireframing style works best</h3>
<p>The style that I believe would work best for my website would have to be block diagrams as since my website would be an encyclipedia of sorts, I would need to use large block diagrams in order to fit all of my text and sort out information.</p>
