    <h1>What I leaned from reading material</h1>
    <p> 1 - I learned that we are currently in web 3.0</p>
    <p> 2 - I learned that the advancement of web 3.0 has led to a greater decentralization of the internet.</p>
    <p> 3 - I learned that newer technologies has allowed the development of several different programming languages which gives users greater freedoms when it comes to developing web based applications.</p>
    <h2>My semester project</h2>
    <p>The goal for my semester project is to create a visual based encyclipedia for the game Final Fantasy 14. Final Fantasy 14 is an MMORPG that is famous for its massive story and lore spanning 5 expansions with each one taking hundreds of hours to complete. The issue is that the further you progress in the game's narrative the more complicated the lore becomes and the more difficult it becomes to keep track of every important detail. Despite FF14 being over a decade old, the game lacks a useful system to keep track of all the lore. This frustrated me for years until very recently when Final Fantasy 16 was released which came with a extremely robust ingame lore guide that explains everything from important characters, locations, terminology & a bestiary all of which would update as the you progress through the game's narrative. My goal is to recreate this system & ui for Final Fantasy 14.</p>
