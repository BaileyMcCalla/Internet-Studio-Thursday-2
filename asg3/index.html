<p> Depending on your internet connection this website might take several seconds to load all of its content.</p>
<p> By framing your project in a storytelling format, you provide yourself with a clearly defined, beginning, middle & end allowing you to bounce off of one act to the next. For example when I was pitching my semester project idea, I used the beginning to establish the background of my project that being centered around the game Final Fantasy XIV. Then I used the middle portion to explain the problem I want to address that being the lack of a comprehensive lore guide for the game. Finally I end the 3rd act by providing the intended solution to this problem that being creating a visual wiki that provides the user with the information they need.</p>
<p>Using bolder & larger font sizes can help draw the viewer to important parts of your website.</p>
