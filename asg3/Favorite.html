	<h3>Personal</h3>
	<p> I had heard about Woodkid before but never paid much attention to his music until 2021 when his music was featured in the action-adventure game Death Stranding 2. I instantly grew to love his unique style of music as he used a wide range of genres such as drum & bass, industrial and indie.</p>
