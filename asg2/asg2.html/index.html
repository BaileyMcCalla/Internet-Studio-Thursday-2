<h1>Structured content vs Semantic HTML</h1>
<p> Structured content is developed content that is compatible with any user interface whereas semantic HTML provides the user with an indepth look into the relationship of elements.</p>
<p> The way the two systems work together in tandem is by providing both the user & reader with a system that is easy to understand and diagetic.</p>
<p> The reason why it is important to have both structured content and semantic HTML in your webpage as this is vital when it comes to ux design for webpages.</p>
<h2>Websites that are similar to my semester project</h2>
<p>Fandom - Which is a wiki based website that catalogs information from various franchises.</p>
<p>Consolegameswiki - A wiki based site that catalogs information from various video games (Currently the most comprehensive wiki for Final Fantasy XIV).</p>
<p>Gamer Escape - A website that covers news, reviews an wikis for Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
<h3>Inner Critic</h3>
<p>I believe my most successful method to banishing my troll like inner critic would have to be to interrorgate myself. My biggest issue is that I procrastinate too much which has become a serious detrimate these past couple of semesters, I find that if I push and challange myself I can get over this major flaw.</p>
<p>I believe that the best method based off of David Mcraney's article is to trick the future me into doing what is right for both parties.</p>
<p>I beleive I have network power as I would have control over how my website functions. I do not have networked power because I cannot control how other users and groups will react to my website. I do not have power over because I do not want to dominate or coerce. I have power with because I am willing to collaborate with others.</p>
